Tensorflow is a google developer product that helps us to make a machine learning model. It is a graph-based computational framework. Tensorflow contains many toolkit that makes it possible to make a model in whatever abstraction level we would want. There are a few APIs that we can choose to determine the mathematical model and architecture.

The implementations of TensorFlow APIs are unimaginable. It eases us to do machine learning, and in turn, make unprecedented amount of analysis between data, and extracting all the good things possible within. Most of the time, the good "juice" of data can't be seen on the outside. It requires rigorous analysis. Tensorflow helps to make ML easier.
